Learning Rust with a file encryption CLI tool.

The aim of this project is mostly about `walking the walk` rather than reaching the goal itself, I used it as a learning ground for rusts workings, futures, types, etc.

The project itself is a file encryption tool, with an interactive command-line interface. It is a `work in progress`, and many things are not yet implemented, and/ or tested. Also as much as I tried to maintain cryptographic security, there was no thorough testing of it.

I advise against using this project for any real world scenarios, and cannot guarantee the integrity or confidentiality measures, nor can I eliminate the possibility of file losses. On the other hand feel free to try the tool for any dummy files, try to break it for fun, etc.

More functionality about to be added as I find time to work e.g:
* a file exploring/picking utility.
* maybe shredding files, however this might not be possible due to the wide usage of ssd-s.
* testing, more options
* gui??
* CI, code quality improvements ...
